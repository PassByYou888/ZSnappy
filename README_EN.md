# ZSnappy 
Recently, I was working on remote desktops, and my hands were sent to the community. Because desktop synchronization uses ffmpeg+mjpeg in the coding phase, a lot of people roast about it 
So, I made a differential image algorithm. ZSnappy is the compression support part of this differential 


# Compatibility Description 
- Supports objfpc/delphi 
- Currently, only x86/x64 versions are available for pre-compilation. I've been a bit busy lately, but I will provide pre-compiled versions for various platforms such as android/ios/linux/osx when I have free time 
- Precompiled x86/x64 requires vs2017 dependent library support
